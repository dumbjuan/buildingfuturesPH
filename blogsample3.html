DAVAO CITY, Philippines — A three-storey electronic library that offers “rich multimedia content and is accessible to the public” is set to be established here.<br><br>
Pedrita Badar, office in-charge of city library, said in an interview with Davao Today that the establishment of an e-library would benefit the public, especially the students who wanted to access books and educational materials for free.<br><br>
“We are in a process [of establishing the e-library], but there are other department projects that should be prioritized so as of now we passed other proposals for the library,” Badar said Monday.<br><br>
Badar’s statement came as the city is set to celebrate the 82nd National Book Week which will start from Nov 21 to 25, bearing the theme: “Today’s Readers: Inclusivity in Diversity.”<br><br>
A national convention for city librarians slated on Tuesday, Nov. 22 at the SMX Convention Center at SM Lanang will also be conducted.<br><br>
Jenelito Atillo, spokesperson of the Department of Education XI, lauded proposed e-library project as this would “enhance the reading skills of the children.”<br><br>
“This will be a very good move. It is actually responding to the needs of the time since we are now more into technology,” he said.
        </p>

        <p>
Atillo said the e-library would limit the students’ access to what he termed as “garbage” materials from the internet.
“This program will be a great help filter those other unnecessary things in the world wide web. It would help limit the students gain access to the inappropriate websites,” he said.<br><br>
The DepEd spokesperson said the aim of the city library would be a practical program for students to encourage them to read books more often.<br><br>
“This effort of the city government will also help us in our goal to entice the students to read more books using the e-library,” he pointed out.<br><br>
“This program is just a one way maybe to rekindle the children’s love for reading,” he said.
Based on the 2013 Functional Literacy, Education and Mass Media Survey, one in every ten, or about 4 million Filipino children and youth, belongs to the out-of-school youth.<br><br>
The highest number of out-of-school children and youth across the regions was recorded in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao which comprised 14.4 percent.<br><br>
Meanwhile, six regions, including Davao, have proportion of out-of-school children and youth higher than the national figure at 10.6 percent. The other regions were SOCCSKSARGEN, Central Luzon, Zamboanga Peninsula, Caraga and MIMAROPA.
